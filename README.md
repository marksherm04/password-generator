## Application Notes
Once the user clicks the Generate Password button, he/she must select how many characters or it will show an error alert and prompt them back to the character selection.  The user must select between 8-128 characters or it will also prompt them backt to the character selection.  Once the user selects an acceptable amount of charcters, their password may contain 1 or all of the password criteria.  If the user selects cancel (no) to all selections, then they will be prompted back to the character selection. This fool proofs the user from skipping past the steps them must take to generate a password.
